Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction Model

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various customer attributes, campaign details, and economic indicators.

Project Phases

📌 Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

Performed feature engineering.

Encoded categorical variables.

Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

Detected and removed outliers.

📌 Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed numerical & categorical features.

Performed correlation analysis to remove redundant features.

Addressed data imbalance using SMOTE.

Selected the most relevant features for classification.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

📌 Phase 4: Model Selection & Training

Trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Compared model performance and selected the best-performing model.

Saved the trained model and pipeline.

Evaluated predictions using classification reports and confusion matrices.

Conclusion

🔍 Key Findings

The dataset had an imbalance in target classes, which was handled using SMOTE.

Correlation analysis helped in selecting the most impactful features.

Gradient Boosting performed better than Random Forest in terms of accuracy.

🛠️ Developed Model

The final model chosen was Gradient Boosting Classifier, tuned with optimal hyperparameters.

The trained model and pipeline were saved for deployment.
